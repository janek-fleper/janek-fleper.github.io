			<h1>LEOPaRD - From LHC to ISS</h1>
		<h3>Low Earth Orbit Particle and Radiation Detector</h3>

		<p>
		We are a group of physics students of the Rheinische Friedrich-Wilhelms-University of Bonn, that apply for the student competition „Überflieger“, hosted by the Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt (DLR). The winners of this competition will be allowed to build a self designed experiment along with carrying out their project at the International Space Station (ISS). They will be supported by the DLR, the Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft (DPG) and other experts. The german ESA-Astronaut Alexander Gerst will take care of the experiments on board of the ISS.
		</p>

		<p>
		As one of eight groups, we have already advanced to be shortlisted for the competition and now we are invited to present our experiment at the DLR department in Bonn on 4/5 May 2017. A committee of experts will afterwards decide who the three winning teams are. We apply with our experiment LEOPaRD.
		</p>

		<p>
		LEOPaRD is an acronym for Low Earth Orbit Particle and Radiation Detector. With our experiment, we aim to measure the radiation intensity on board of the ISS with respect to the ISS’ position above the earth. On the one hand, we would like to investigate the earth’s radiation environment on possible fluctuations in intensity and potential sources for that. On the other hand, it might be interesting to look for a dependence of the radiation’s intensity on different seasons. This is at least expected, due to the earth’s movement around the sun. After all, it is also of utmost importance for astronauts and technology on board of the ISS to exactly know the incoming radiation level, in order to protect them from too much radiation exposure. Our experiment will definitely be able to determine the exposure rate to cosmic radiation inside of the ISS.		
		</p>

		<p>
		The earth is continuously exposed to cosmic radiation, consisting of charged particles such as protons, electrons or heavier ionised atoms. These particles can attain energies, that exceed currently achievable energies at human built accelerators in a considerable fashion. Since the earth is shielded by its magnetic field and its atmosphere, people on the earth’s surface are secure from radiation. However, to the amount of a few 100 kilometres, the impact of insulating effects decreases and high energetic particles strike all objects on the sky nearly undamped. Therefore this location is of unique interest for experiments of particle physics. This also accounts for our experiment, since one can survey the cosmic radiation at the ISS’ orbit at about 400 km of height relatively unhindered.
		</p>

		<p>
		To detect the cosmic radiation we will use a telescope consisting of three semiconducting pixel detectors, that are stacked on top of each other. By using multiple detector-layers we can reconstruct the particles’ tracks and therefore their direction of entrance can be determined. Along with some readout electronics, incoming particles can then be measured as a function of their incident direction and with respect to their intensity. When combining the collected data with information about the ISS’ location and orientation, an intensity profile for the International Space Station can then be generated.
		The detector modules originate from the Silicon Laboratory (SiLab) of the University of Bonn, which works on developing and producing the modules for the pixel detector of the ATLAS-Experiment at CERN in Geneva. Moreover, the SiLab kindly provides us with the necessary infrastructure concerning tests and adjustments of the detector. This will ensure, that our experiment operates correctly.
		</p>

		<p>
		The ISS offers the option to communicate with the experiment during operation via an internet connection. The detector should collect data as long as possible. The measured data will be published on this website. Furthermore we will provide a continuously updated map, that illustrates the measured intensity as a function of its position above the earth.
		</p>

		<p>
		We are happy to have some of SiLab’s employees by our side as our team members. Moreover we can also rely on the expertise of the Argelander-Institut für Astronomie (AIfA) of the University of Bonn. Therefore we are confident, that we will be able to realize our experiment alongside the support of expert knowledge from detector- and astrophysics!
		</p>

		<p>
		We are looking forward to the workshop at the DLR!
